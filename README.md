- We want to build a platform which contents open-source projects. You can list all published open-source projects and also you can publish your project too from GitHub.

## Want to Contribute?

You have 2 things you can do:

1. Either open an issue about a bug, feature request, page, or component,
2. __Or__ close an issue, by writing and/or implementing it in your own fork!


## ⚒️ Build Setup 

We use **yarn** as the package manager

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## CSS Library
We use tailwind css as the css library. You can access the documentation [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
